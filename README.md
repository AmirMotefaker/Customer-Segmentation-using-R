# Customer Segmentation using R

- Customer Segmentation is one of the most important applications of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In this machine learning project, we will make use of K-means clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled datasets.
